# Gaussian Blur & Canny Edge Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of applying Gaussian blur, adding noise to an image, and performing Canny edge detection to observe how noise affects edge detection accuracy.

## Steps Performed
- Load the input image in grayscale.  
- Apply Gaussian blur for smoothing.  
- Add Gaussian noise to the blurred image.  
- Perform Canny edge detection on the noisy image.  
- Display and compare all results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Install the dependencies using:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

## Execution
1. Open the `Workshop3.ipynb` file.  
2. Run each cell in order.  
3. View the outputs of the original, blurred + noisy, and edge-detected images.

## Expected Output
- Original grayscale image  
- Gaussian blurred image with added noise  
- Canny edge detection result showing edges with visible noise effects
